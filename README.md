# R Web Scraping and Text Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project uses R to perform web scraping and text analysis on product reviews from Amazon. The script `R-Script.R` navigates to a product review page, extracts review titles, and performs text processing to identify frequently occurring words. This analysis is visualized using `ggplot2`, offering insights into common themes in product reviews.
